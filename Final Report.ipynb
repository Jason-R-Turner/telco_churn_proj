    "## Project overview\n",
    "- This is a data science project using the telcoCo data set from the Codeup database that demonstrates using Python, Jupyter notebook, creating modueles, and using Github.\n",
    "- It shows the process of using the data science pipeline to plan, acquire, prepare, explore, model, and present the data in a 5 minute presentation.\n",
    "- The presentation is directed towards the direct manager and their manager with the intent of better understanding the reasons behind customer churn to include expaining why, what, and how I began my investigation and came to a conclusion with key takeaways.\n",
    "- The reason why I decided to build this project by asking these questions is because I believe these may be overlooked areas that could show some easier ways we could lower churn"

    "## Project Plan:\n",
    "The plan is to use our access to the Codeup database to acquire data which we'll use to figure out why customers at the Telco Co are churning.\n",
    "Once we've written the proper python code in a module to acquire the data that we want we'll run it and save it as a cache to our local computer.\n",
    "From there we'll use another module which we'll use to prepare our data by splitting it up into three separate groups making sure that the variable we want, which is churn is evenly distributed.\n",
    "The three groups will be train, our largest group, validate, and test.\n",
    "Depending on the question we're asking we'll run various statistical tests and produce visualizations to help us better understand the data.\n",
    "Once we're ready to model our data we will encode it into numbers that our machine learning algorithms can accept.\n",
    "We'll select appropriate models that can be run based on the kind of data that we're dealing with.\n",
    "We'll run it through multiple machine models till we come up with our best ones.\n",
    "We'll use run the model using our validate set to further narrow these down to our single best model.\n",
    "We'll then use our untouched test set with the best model to make our best predictions."

    "## Goals\n",
    "- To uncover the main reasons why customers churn here at Telco\n",
    "- To create a report that non-data scientists can understand by asking the following:\n",
    "1. Do customers who use Tech Support churn at a significantly different rate and if so is it more or less?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the rates of churn of 1 and 2 year contracts both before and after fullfilling their obligations as compared to month-to-month contracts?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What groups of customers pay the most in monthly charges but aren't churning?\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Is there a significant difference in correlation between monthly charges and tenure for customers churn vs those who do not?"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- There are many different factors that show some correlation or dependence in relation to churn\n",
    "- This is a fairly small number of people compare to other telecommnucations companies, so there may be other factors at play that may result in spurious correlations\n",
    "- The churn we see is likely the culmination of many factors that result in higher overall charges and the ease of switching without the yearly contracts.\n",
    "- My recommendation is that we increase our profit margin by raising prices saying it's necessary due to inflation but offer a friends & family plans at a slightly discounted rate so that they encourage people to they know to join their plan, making it more difficult for them to churn on their own.\n",
    "- To improve our results I suggest that we get credit alerts for our customers to determine who is struggling financially since we may be able to offer them alternative  forms of payment like lines of credit for loans."
